# GNS Users

Boilerplate user management with REST API

Notes:
- Wanted to use Flask to create server easily but what about no UI
- Aimed to create nice API endpoints, how to manage authentication? Went to hardest part first
- Had to do as great artists and [see best example](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/REST-auth/blob/master/api.py)
- Aimed to use advanced DB management but not familiar with SQLAlchemy
